## 📖 Overview

Welcome to the comprehensive documentation of my **100 Days of Machine Learning** challenge. This repository serves as a centralized knowledge base, archiving my daily progress, code implementations, theoretical notes, and hands-on projects as I mastered the landscape of Artificial Intelligence from scratch.

The goal of this journey was not just to write code, but to understand the **mathematical intuition** behind algorithms, master **data preprocessing** techniques, and implement robust **predictive models** without relying solely on black-box libraries.

## 🧠 Key Learning Modules

This curriculum is structured to build a strong foundation before advancing to complex algorithms.

### 🔹 Phase 1: Data Engineering & Preprocessing
*Before any model can learn, the data must be understood.*
- **Data Handling & Preparation:** Mastering Pandas for data manipulation and profiling.
- **Handling Missing Data & Outliers:** Techniques for imputation (Mean/Median/Mode, KNN Imputer) and outlier detection (Z-Score, IQR).
- **Feature Engineering:** Transforming raw data into meaningful features (One-Hot Encoding, Ordinal Encoding, Scaling).

### 🔹 Phase 2: Supervised Learning (Regression & Classification)
*Teaching machines to map inputs to outputs.*
- **Linear Regression:** Understanding relationships between continuous variables, Gradient Descent, and Cost Functions.
- **Logistic Regression:** Binary classification, Sigmoid functions, and decision boundaries.
- **Support Vector Machines (SVM):** Hyperplanes, Kernels (RBF, Polynomial), and margin maximization.
- **Naive Bayes:** Probabilistic classifiers based on Bayes' Theorem (Gaussian, Multinomial, Bernoulli).
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN):** Distance metrics (Euclidean, Manhattan) and the curse of dimensionality.
- **Decision Trees:** Entropy, Information Gain, Gini Impurity, and pruning techniques.

### 🔹 Phase 3: Unsupervised Learning
*Finding hidden patterns in unlabeled data.*
- **K-Means Clustering:** Centroid initialization, the Elbow Method, and Silhouette Scores.
- **Agglomerative Clustering:** Hierarchical clustering, Dendrograms, and linkage criteria.

### 🔹 Phase 4: Ensemble Learning & Advanced Techniques
*Combining weak learners to create a strong predictor.*
- **Ensemble Learning:** Bagging, Boosting, and Random Forests.
- **Stacking & Blending:** Meta-models and multi-layer model architectures.
- **Voting Classifiers:** Hard vs. Soft voting probabilities.

## 📊 Sample Visualizations

Throughout this journey, I focused heavily on visualizing data distributions and model boundaries. Here are examples of the types of analysis included in the notebooks:

* **Correlation Heatmaps** to identify feature relationships.
* **Scatter Plots** with decision boundaries for SVM and Logistic Regression.
* **Dendrograms** for Hierarchical Clustering.
* **Elbow Curves** for determining optimal  in K-Means.
