🧠 100 Days of Machine Learning Journey

Welcome to my 100 Days of ML Journey! 🚀
This repository is a complete record of my progress as I learn and practice Machine Learning step by step, covering both theory and practical coding.

The repo includes:

📖 Daily Notes – concepts learned each day

💻 Coding Exercises – Jupyter notebooks with ML implementations

📂 Projects – small projects on toy datasets & real-world data

📝 PDF Roadmap – structured plan followed for the 100 days

🚀 What’s Covered?

Day 1–20: Python, Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn (data handling & visualization)

Day 21–40: Statistics, Probability, Linear Algebra, Calculus (math for ML)

Day 41–60: Machine Learning basics (Supervised, Unsupervised, Evaluation metrics)

Day 61–80: ML models in practice (Regression, Classification, Clustering, SVM, Decision Trees, Random Forests, etc.)

Day 81–90: Feature engineering, model optimization, and real-world ML workflow

Day 91–100: Mini-projects, capstone tasks, and revision

🛠️ Tools & Libraries
